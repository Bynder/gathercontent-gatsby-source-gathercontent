# GatherContent & Gatsby Demo Site

## Prerequisites

1. A [GatherContent](https://gathercontent.com/) account.

2. Create a GatherContent API Key by following these [instructions](https://docs.gathercontent.com/reference#authentication).

3. Every GatherContent account comes with a set of examples projects. This demo works with a specific example project named "Course records (headless CMS example)". You'll need the project id, which you can find in the project settings.

If you can't find this project on your account then our [support team](https://gathercontent.com) can help.

## Config

To build the site, create a `.env.development` file. You can see an example via `.env.example`.

```shell
# .env.development
GATSBY_GC_EMAIL=<email>
GATSBY_GC_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
GATSBY_GC_PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
```

## Build & view the demo

```shell
npm install
npm run develop
```

The demo should now be running at http://localhost:8000! 

You can start editing the code in `src` or update the content in your GatherContent project to see updates happen locally.

## Live edits

A known challenge of using Gatsby is seeing live content edits in a development environment. 

You can manually rebuild the project by re-running `npm run develop` or you can run `npm run refresh`! 

By using the refresh command, you won't need to manually restart your development server saving you time üëç
